## **Let's talk about socks...**
1. The way I accessed the data with the API was not the most efficient, but it was the easiest for me. I first accessed the server using my key, and then accessed the endpoint, "/socks." After doing this, I was able to convert the endpoint into a json object, which I then created a method for which turned it into a dictionary. This dictionary was much easier for me to deal with than the original json object itself.

> tube socks
> ultra no-show socks

 <-- these all have 8 variations, which is the most variations any type of sock has.

4. This lab was one of the harder ones for me, because firstly I was unfamiliar with the API syntax and I wasn't quite sure if I was doing everything correctly at first, and additionally, I think my vscode was not working great with requests for some reason. I finished the my code on repl.it, and it worked much better. The main thing I had issues with was with finding a way to iterate through the API properly. I tried a While loop and ended up with an infinite loop, and did some other incorrect things and was not finding success. In the end, I decided it would likely be the most efficient for me to make a dictionary of the json object instead because I had much higher familiarity with data in that format. Ultimately, the two methods were not incredibly complicated, but actually accessing the data was my big roadblock in this assignment. I learned quite a lot about APIs throughout this assignment. Firstly, I now have a much better understanding of the format of the json object after having to convert it to a dictionary, and honestly after all of the research it took to make that dictionary, I think I could have probably used the json object directly in my methods instead of converting it into a dictionary first. I also learned more about the endpoint characteristic of APIs and realized that for this lab in particular, I could combine my endpoint with my url because the only folder I ever needed to access was the socks folder. Overall, this lab was very informative and was a great introduction to APIs. Throughout this lab, I worked with Feingold, Ahaan, Thomas, Aydan, and Yash.
