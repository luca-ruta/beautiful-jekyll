Lets write a little story about a little boy named luca. once upon a time, he was born. he drank water with elephants and ran races with cheetahs and climbed with giraffes. he was a natural man who spawned in from the earth and grew into a moving tree, like groot but more normal looking. his bark hardnered but it turned into skin instead so luca looked totallyt normaly. but today, he has inflitrated horace mann and now is threatening to return the school to the trees. he will start with the wood tables and turn them into tree people. then he will go to the trees outside and wake them up too. it will be a big riot, and only luca will survive in the end, the lonely king of horace mann.
