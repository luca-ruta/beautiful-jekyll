## **We did a little question answering...**
1. The null hypothesis is not explicitly stated in the paper but can be inferred as there being no significant differences in the microbiomes of African penguins under managed conditions compared to their exhibit environment in the wild. Conversely, the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference in the microbiomes of African penguins compared to their exhibit environment in the wild. 
2. The research data was collected by the authors of the study, primarily from African penguins housed at Georgia Aquarium. The authors also mention that some samples were collected while the penguins were removed from their exhibit for routine health exams or other necessary reasons.
3. The study references various datasets, including DNA sequencing data from African penguins and other vertebrates. These datasets are publicly available on the NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, according to the sourcing section of this paper.
4. I may be missing the more major implications of this study that the researchers were interested in, but at least on the surface level, they seem interested in the microbiome of African penguins, its relationship with the environment, and how managed care conditions might affect it.
5. The data being recorded includes DNA sequences of microbial communities in penguins and other animals. Some data that might be left out could be specific environmental conditions or detailed information on penguin behavior. This would have provided a qualitative analysis on the data compared to the sole quantitative data we are presented.
6. The evidence presented includes comparisons of microbiome diversity and composition in penguins and other animals, as well as statistical analyses. The data and statistical tests support their conclusions.
7. The paper doesn't state the source of funding for the study.
8. It is not the easiest for me to say whether this paper was influenced by publish or perish because that would also mean that I have to understand the data better, but my best guess is that there was some influence. To begin with, this study seems relatively useless because it seems sort of obvious that animals of the same species would not share all the same microbiomes if they were in the wild versus in managed conditions, but beyond that, there seems to be little use in the confirmation of the alternative hypothesis.
